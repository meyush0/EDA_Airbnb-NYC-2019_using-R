#  Airbnb NYC 2019 Data Analysis

## > Introduction
### The purpose of this project is to analyze the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset and provide insights into various aspects of the data. The dataset contains information on Airbnb listings in New York City, such as the price, location, host information, reviews, and availability.


## > What is Airbnb?
### Airbnb is a popular online marketplace and hospitality service that allows people to rent out their homes, apartments, or other forms of accommodation to travelers. Founded in 2008, Airbnb has grown to become a leading platform in the sharing economy, connecting hosts with guests from all around the world. Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to list their properties, communicate with guests, manage bookings, and process payments. Guests can search for accommodations based on location, price, amenities, and other criteria, and can book directly with hosts. Airbnb also offers a range of experiences and activities hosted by local experts, allowing travelers to immerse themselves in the local culture and community.

## > Dataset
### The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset can be found on Kaggle here. It contains information on 48,895 Airbnb listings in New York City in 2019. The dataset has 16 variables, including price, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room type, minimum nights, number of reviews, and more.

## >Technologies
###  1. R version 4.1.1
###  2. RStudio version 1.4.1717
###  3. Libraries: tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, ggmap

## >Analysis
### The analysis consists of the following steps:

### 1. Loading the data and examining its structure and summary
### 2. Data cleaning, which includes finding and handling missing values and checking for duplicates
### 3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between variables using scatter-plots and correlation matrices
### 4. Analyzing the relationship between price and categorical variables such as neighborhood and neighborhood group
### 5. Visualization using barplots, histograms, and heatmaps

## >Conclusion
### From the analysis, we can conclude that price is the most important factor when booking a room, followed by neighborhood group and neighborhood. Manhattan is the most expensive place to stay, followed by Brooklyn and Queens, while the least expensive places are the Bronx and Staten Island. The dataset also reveals interesting relationships between different variables, such as the negative correlation between the number of reviews and availability_365.
