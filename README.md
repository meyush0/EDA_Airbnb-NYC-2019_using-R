#Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset and provide insights into various aspects of the data. The dataset contains information on Airbnb listings in New York City, such as the price, location, host information, reviews, and availability.

#Dataset
The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset can be found on Kaggle here. It contains information on 48,895 Airbnb listings in New York City in 2019. The dataset has 16 variables, including price, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room type, minimum nights, number of reviews, and more.

#Technologies
R version 4.1.1
RStudio version 1.4.1717
Libraries: tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, ggmap
Analysis
The analysis consists of the following steps:

#Loading the data and examining its structure and summary
Data cleaning, which includes finding and handling missing values and checking for duplicates
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between variables using scatter-plots and correlation matrices
Analyzing the relationship between price and categorical variables such as neighborhood and neighborhood group
Visualization using barplots, histograms, and heatmaps
Conclusion
From the analysis, we can conclude that price is the most important factor when booking a room, followed by neighborhood group and neighborhood. Manhattan is the most expensive place to stay, followed by Brooklyn and Queens, while the least expensive places are the Bronx and Staten Island. The dataset also reveals interesting relationships between different variables, such as the negative correlation between the number of reviews and availability_365.
